# Epilet-Watch
The Epilet is a wearable device that employs machine learning algorithms to detect Convulsive Epileptic Seizures (CES) in real-time. Distinguished by its use of Federated Machine Learning (FML), it ensures maximum data privacy. The Epilet band uses the DAP (detection, avoidance and prevention) method and incorporates an array of sensors– accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature sensor, light intensity sensor and a digital microphone– all integrated into the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.
The process was challenging — countless hours went into refining the technology, from training the band’s machine learning model on an extensive database through a collaboration with the Institute of Public Health to ensure accuracy to developing the first working prototype.
